# ü§ñ AI Model Comparison: Basic vs Advanced

## Question: "when was last time cpu usage spiked"

### ‚ùå Basic AI Model Response:
```
AI Answer: Current CPU usage is 62.6% (average: 50.2%). CPU usage is elevated but within acceptable ranges.

AI Reasoning: Analyzed CPU metrics: current=62.6%, average=50.2%, anomalies=0. Severity assessment: moderate (elevated).
```

**Problem**: The basic model didn't understand the temporal question and just gave current status.

### ‚úÖ Advanced AI Model Response:
```
AI Answer: The last significant CPU usage spike occurred on 2025-07-26 at 12:54:52 with 68.2% usage. Related errors: High memory usage detected. (2), Unhandled exception in worker thread. (1). The previous spike was on 2025-07-25 at 04:13:52 with 92.1% usage.

AI Reasoning: Found 151 CPU spikes above 67.9% threshold. Analyzed 17 logs within ¬±5 minutes of latest spike.
```

**Improvement**: The advanced model correctly understood the temporal question and provided specific historical data.

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Temporal Understanding**
- **Basic**: Ignores temporal keywords (when, last, previous)
- **Advanced**: Recognizes and responds to temporal questions

### 2. **Historical Analysis**
- **Basic**: Only analyzes current state
- **Advanced**: Searches through historical data for specific events

### 3. **Specific Answers**
- **Basic**: Generic status updates
- **Advanced**: Exact timestamps and values for events

### 4. **Context Awareness**
- **Basic**: Limited context
- **Advanced**: Correlates events with related logs and errors

### 5. **Multiple Events**
- **Basic**: Single current state
- **Advanced**: Shows multiple historical events (latest + previous)

## üìä More Examples

### Question: "when did memory usage peak"
**Advanced Response**: "The last significant memory usage spike occurred on 2025-07-26 at 15:31:52 with 71.1% usage. Related errors: Database connection timeout. (1), Out of memory error. (1), Slow query detected. (1)."

### Question: "what was the last error"
**Advanced Response**: "The last error occurred on 2025-07-27 at 03:28:52: Slow query detected. Recent error types: API response time above threshold. (70), High memory usage detected. (64), Slow query detected. (56)..."

### Question: "when was the system slow"
**Advanced Response**: "The last significant latency spike occurred on 2025-07-26 at 12:57:52 with 154.0ms response time."

## üöÄ Advanced Model Features

1. **Temporal Keyword Recognition**: when, last, previous, before, after, recent, spike, peak, high, low
2. **Statistical Spike Detection**: Uses mean + 2*std threshold for meaningful spikes
3. **Historical Event Search**: Finds specific events in time series data
4. **Log Correlation**: Links events with related error logs
5. **Multiple Event Reporting**: Shows latest and previous events
6. **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides relevant context for each event

## ‚úÖ Result

The advanced AI model now correctly answers temporal questions like:
- ‚úÖ "when was last time cpu usage spiked"
- ‚úÖ "when did memory usage peak" 
- ‚úÖ "what was the last error"
- ‚úÖ "when was the system slow"
- ‚úÖ "show me recent spikes"
- ‚úÖ "when did the system last have issues"

Your app now has **sophisticated temporal analysis** that can answer historical questions about system events!
